**How are graceful degredation and service workers related?**

Graceful degredation and service workers are related because graceful degredation is a design philosophy that ensures a web application remains functional when certain features fail, (such as the javascript not loading), and service workers relate since they essentially handle requests based on whether or not the network is present (i.e. the network fails).
